        <div class="quote-text">"As the head commander of Westhelm, I’ve experienced battles, diplomacy, and the thrill of leading a civilization to glory. Participating in the 1000-player civilization simulation was unlike anything else—it was a masterpiece of coordination, creativity, and strategy. The alliances we forged, the cities we built, and the stories we lived are memories I'll cherish forever.
            But this upcoming Purge simulation is a whole new beast. It's not about civilizations or grand alliances; it’s about survival—pure and raw. Small groups, close bonds, and split-second decisions will make the difference between victory and defeat. It’s personal this time, and I’m ready to face the chaos head-on, alongside the few I trust with my life." (ChatGPT)</div>
